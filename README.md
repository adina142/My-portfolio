 My Portfolio Template using html and css.
Navbar: A fixed-top navigation bar that helps users easily navigate between different sections of the portfolio, such as Home, Education, Skills, Projects, Certificates, and Contact.

Sidebar: A side navigation menu that provides quick access to the sections of the portfolio, particularly useful on mobile devices. This sidebar is hidden initially on smaller screens and can be toggled using a button.

Home Section: An introductory section where I present myself with a brief bio, showcasing my academic background, skills, and aspirations. It includes a profile picture and a welcome message.

Education Section: A table displaying my academic history, including matriculation, intermediate, and ongoing Bachelor's degree details.

Skills Section: A section that displays my skill sets in various areas like Mobile-App development, Artificial Intelligence, MySQL, Java, and C++ with progress bars indicating my proficiency in each skill.

Projects Section: A showcase of my key projects, where each project is described along with an image. The projects mentioned include:

TeleDoc: An Android-based telemedicine application.
Vim-Like Text Editor: A command-line text editor that mimics the functionality of Vim.
Chess Game: A console-based chess game developed as part of a Programming Fundamentals project.
Certificates Section: A carousel displaying certificates I've earned from participating in competitions and challenges, such as the Ripah Computing Cup Challenge and the Code Rush Programming Challenge.

Some Key Highlights:
Responsive Design: The website adapts well to different screen sizes with the use of Bootstrap and custom CSS, ensuring a good user experience across devices.
Interactive Features: The sidebar toggle feature and the carousel for displaying certificates add interactivity to the design.
Project Showcase: Your projects are presented with descriptions and images, giving visitors a clear understanding of your work and expertise.
